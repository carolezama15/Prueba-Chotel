Chotel has 2 views.

The first has a filter to checkin, checkout and room's type, click search and get the rooms.
You have 2 options, reserve (bed Icon) and see reserves(eye).

The second view is the reserves, where you can delete or edit the reserves.

The datebase is on cloud, specifically in Firebase, so you don't need a script to creat it.
